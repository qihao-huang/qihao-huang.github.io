# [Long-Term Feature Banks for Detailed Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05038.pdf)

_Jan 2019_

tl;dr: Create a long-term feature bank (list of short term features) as attention signal to augment short term features for classification.

#### Overall impression
The paper builds on top of existing work of video understanding (Non-local net) and addresses the issue of how to exploit the long term signal, given the limited memory.  Thus the *same* features represent both the present and the long-term context. This work tries to *decouple* the two, allowing long term feature bank to store flexible features that compliment the short term features. 

#### Previous works
- Previous work extract features with pretrained network from individual frames and then feed the features into a RNN or pooling net.
- Use agressive subsampling to fit the entire video into GPU memory.
- **3D CNN** takes in a short clip of 2-5 seconds and computes a feature map, which is then RoIAligned with region proposals (pre-computed from a single frame?) to compute the RoI features for each actor. It captures short term informaiton.

#### Key ideas
- Extend 3D CNN with two ideas:
  - Long term feature bank: list of features extracted from list of short clips, each of $N_t \times d$ dimension, where the $N_t$ is number of detected actors in the short clip at time $t$, and $d$ is the fixed dimension of a RoI feature. 
  - Feature bank operator (FBO): computes interaction between short term features and long term features, through a non-local block or feature pooling and concat.

- The input of the FBO is not the entire feature bank $L$ but only a window $\widetilde{L}$ of $2w+1$. The output of the FBO is channel-wise concatenated with local features into a classifier. 

- One implementation of FBO Non-local blocks:

$$
S_t^{(1)} = NL'_{\theta_1} (S_t, \tilde{L_t}) \\
S_t^{(2)} = NL'_{\theta_2} (S_t^{(1)}, \tilde{L_t}) \\
\vdots
$$
  - The output of the non-local blocks are 512 and then are concatenated with the short term features 2048. 

- Another implementation of FBO is through avg/max pooling through time dimension, yielding 2048 long term dimensions to be concatenated with short term features 2048.

- Backbone: pretrained 2D ResNet inflated into 3D (I3D). The same architecture is used to calculated long and short term features, but parameters are not shared (separately trained models).

- RoIpooling: video backbone features (16x14x14) is first average pooled in time, then RoIAligned into 7x7 regional features, then spatial max pooled into 1x1x1x2048 dimension features. *This should be the d the paper referes to.* *The region proposals are computed with pretrained model on the center frame of the center clip (to be verified).*

#### Technical details
- Both short and long term features are extracted using 32 input frames with temporal stride of 2 (~2 seconds in 30 FPS videos). Long term features are computed 1 clip per second. If the video has S seconds, then the long term feature bank is a list containing S long term features. *Note that the overlap is half of the input window.* 
- Ablation results
  - Increasing temporal support hurts the performance of 3D CNN and 3D CNN with self-attention.  Temporal convolution might not be suitable for long-term patterns.
  - Even with fixed pretrained 3D CNN, the performance is pretty high for final results (24.3 vs optimal 25.5 vs baseline 22.3 mAP). I think the **benefit from feature decoupling is overrated** by the autors. 
  - Using 2x2 grid features also acheves very good results comared to RoIAligned features (25.1 vs 25.5 mAP).
  - Non-local design of FBO is much better than feature pooling (23.2 vs 25.5 mAP).
  - TTA significantly improves performance (28.0 vs 25.5 mAP)
- Improving LFB and backbone are complementary and they improve different types of tasks (interactive actions, talk to, throw, hit, etc vs standalone ones, climb, take a photo, etc). 

#### Notes
- This work on long term feature bank seems to have been developed in parallel with [SlowFast Network](./paper_notes/slow_fast_net.md) based on the publication date on ArXiv. Both addresses the issue of how to exploit long term signal.
- The work may be applicable to CT data analysis by building a long term feature bank across the entire body length. This should be helpful in understanding the anatomy.

#### Things to follow up
- Layer normalization: why is it useful in video understanding?
- I3D/C3D

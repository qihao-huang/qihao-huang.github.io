# [Human-Centric Efficiency Improvements in Image Annotation for Autonomous Driving](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DY95vfWBLKOOZZyq8gLDd0heZ6aBSdji/view) 

_June 2020_

tl;dr: How to generate masks with few vertices that is easy to edit by human annotator. 

#### Overall impression
Use [extreme point clicking](extreme_clicking.md) and [DEXTR: Deep Extreme Cut](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09081) <kbd>CVPR 2018</kbd> ([code](https://github.com/scaelles/DEXTR-PyTorch)) to improve efficiency. 

The task improved human annotation of semantic segmentation by almost 4x without degradation of quality.

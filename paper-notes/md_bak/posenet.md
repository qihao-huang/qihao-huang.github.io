tl;dr: Summary of the main idea.

#### Overall impression
Describe the overall impression of the paper. 

Note: this PoseNet is used for relocalization. The PoseNet mentioned in [openpilot's architecture](https://medium.com/@comma_ai/a-tour-through-openpilot-a6589a801ed0) is actually the PoseNet/Pose-CNN in [sfm Learner](sfm_learner.md).

# [CenterMask: Single Shot Instance Segmentation With Point Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04446)

_April 2020_

tl;dr: Summary of the main idea.

#### Overall impression
[CenterMask](centermask.md) works almost in exactly the same way as [BlendMask](blendmask.md). See [my review on Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/single-stage-instance-segmentation-a-review-1eeb66e0cc49).

- [CenterMask](centermask.md) uses 1 prototype mask (named global saliency map) explicitly. 
- [CenterMask](centermask.md)'s name comes from the fact that it uses [CenterNet](centernet.md) as the backbone, while [CenterMask](centermask.md) uses the similar anchor-free one-stage [FCOS](fcos.md) as backbone.

# [Self-Supervised Learning of Depth and Ego-motion with Differentiable Bundle Adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13163)

_July 2020_

tl;dr: Introduce [BA-Net](banet.md) into [SfM learner](sfm_learner.md).

#### Overall impression
The paper looks to be SOTA compared to the papers it cites. However the performance looks on par with [monodepth2](monodepth2.md). The performance is actually not as good as BA-Net on KITTI.

The paper spent too much texts on explaining the existing work of [BA-Net](banet.md). The main innovation of the paper seems to be using poseNet to provide a good initial guess of the camera pose.
